HappyMoments
============
This simple Android app is a "digital jar" of your happy moments.

Whenever you feel especially happy about something, you add a note in the "jar". Later, especially when you want to get cheered up, you pick a random happy moment from the jar, and by remembering how you felt you can re-live the happy moment.

This is the second pre-release. More features are coming in May 2013, such as:
* option: take a photo when adding a happy moment
* option: add location when adding a happy moment
* option: share a happy moment on twitter, facebook or other social networks
* edit happy moments
* delete happy moments
* search
